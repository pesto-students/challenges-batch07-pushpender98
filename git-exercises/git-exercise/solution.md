# Git Excercise insights
- I commited something in a new branch, but I am not able to find anything in the .git tree
- "git show" help me to understand when and where I have commited.
- Didn't get how to give annoted tag

Learning : 
- There are many new commands that are new to me like git show. Until now I was using only fork or github desktop.
- I have never created any repo using cmd, I tried it and it looks great
